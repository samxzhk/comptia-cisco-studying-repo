<h2 style="text-align:center;">Welcome!</h2>

 This is a repository I've decide to create so as to organize my studying materials for CompTIA certificate exams and /or CISCO certificate exams.
 
  I'm not really really planning on taking the test, because I'm too poor at the moment and I can't even think about affording a costy exam like this one, BUT the knowledge on the IT field that I can get from studying for these exams are extremely valuable and maybe when I get a job I'll be able to pay for them

And of course by sharing these contents I might help somebody here. Who knows??? (even though these are just some notes...)

<h2 style="text-align:center;">IMPORTANT</h2>

this is originally a Obsidian vault I've made soo If something doesn't display correctly for you while you're glancing at the files, it is because I might have added some Obsidian plugin and Github doesn't have a feature to process the plugin.
